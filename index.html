		<p>RobotCoding is built around the coding problems from Ingraham High School's <a href="https://ingrahamrobotics.org/resources/ftc-programming-resources/" target="_blank">FIRST Tech Challenge team's Coding Binder.</a> These problems were written by Ariel Rotter-Aboyoun to train new members of the team in the fundamentals and syntax of RobotC. After a successful competition season using the binder, she decided that she wanted to share and build her RobotC training in a wider community.</p>
